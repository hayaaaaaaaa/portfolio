## About This Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's designed from the ground up to showcase my journey as a first-year Computer Engineering student, highlighting my technical skills, featured projects, and notable achievements.

The website features a clean, modern, and fully responsive "Purple Sunset" theme with smooth scroll-based animations to create an engaging user experience.

## âœ¨ Key Features

    *   Home (Hero Section)
    *   About Me
    *   Technical Skills
